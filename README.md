Data Visualization and DNN for Electric Motor Data
Data set taken from https://www.kaggle.com/wkirgsn/electric-motor-temperature

EManalysis.py is a visualization of the data. Line graphs and heat maps seemed to be the best way to visualize the data
to understand the relationships between the parameters


EM-ML.py is a DNN that predicts the temperatures of the rotor and it's components. It can predict more but I kept it short and simple

Both projects can be considered WIPs as they have no real end goal.
